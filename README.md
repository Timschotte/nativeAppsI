# nativeAppsI
This repository contains the solutions to the exercises for the course NativeApps I and an app I created.
It contains the best practices to build an Android App.
Some of the topics it covers:
- Activities & Fragments (With their lifecycles)
- Recyclerview
- MVVM
- Network access with the help of:
  - Moshi
  - ReactiveX/RxAndroid
  - Dagger2
  - Retrofit
- Persistence with Android Room 
- Some espresso tests

The app itself (in the map Memory) is some kind of diary app where you can store memories. A memory is coupled to a Quote of the Day, received from https://quotes.rest/
